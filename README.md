# Heart Disease Classification Project

A machine learning solution for predicting heart disease risk using clinical patient data. This project implements a complete data science pipeline from initial data exploration through model deployment.

## Problem Statement

Cardiovascular disease accounts for approximately 17.9 million deaths annually worldwide. Early detection and risk assessment are critical for preventive care. This project develops a predictive model to assist healthcare professionals in identifying patients at higher risk of developing heart disease.

## Technical Implementation

**Data Science Pipeline:**
- Comprehensive exploratory data analysis with statistical insights
- Feature engineering and data preprocessing
- Multiple algorithm evaluation and hyperparameter tuning
- Cross-validation for robust model assessment
- Performance optimization using various classification metrics

**Technology Stack:**
- **Python 3** - Core programming language
- **Pandas/NumPy** - Data manipulation and numerical computing
- **Scikit-learn** - Machine learning algorithms and evaluation
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn** - Data visualization and statistical plotting
- **Jupyter Notebook** - Interactive development environment
- **Joblib** - Model serialization and deployment

## Model Performance

The final model demonstrates strong predictive capability:
- Evaluated using precision, recall, and F1-score metrics
- ROC-AUC analysis for threshold optimization
- Cross-validation scores for generalization assessment
- Confusion matrix analysis for classification insights
