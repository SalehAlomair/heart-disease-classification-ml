# 🫀 Heart Disease Classification with Machine Learning

This is an end-to-end machine learning project that aims to predict the presence of heart disease using clinical data. The notebook demonstrates a complete ML pipeline — from data preparation and exploration to model evaluation and deployment.

## 📌 Project Overview

Heart disease remains one of the leading causes of death globally. This project leverages supervised learning techniques to build a binary classification model that predicts whether a patient is likely to develop heart disease based on several medical attributes.

The goal is to simulate a real-world machine learning workflow and demonstrate proficiency in working with structured data, feature engineering, model evaluation, and exporting trained models.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- Python 3
- Pandas & NumPy
- Matplotlib & Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook
- Joblib

## 🔍 Key Steps

1. **Data Loading & Cleaning**  
   - Loaded dataset and handled missing or inconsistent values.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Visualized distributions, correlations, and potential relationships between features.

3. **Model Training & Selection**  
   - Trained a classification model using `scikit-learn`.
   - Evaluated performance with metrics like precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC AUC.

4. **Model Exporting**  
   - Saved the trained model using `joblib` for future use.

## 📈 Performance

The model was evaluated using the following metrics:
- Accuracy
- Precision & Recall
- F1-score
- ROC Curve and AUC
